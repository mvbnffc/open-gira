# Data mostly from the Final Report of the Global Wind Atlas project:
# https://energiforskning.dk/files/slutrapporter/gwa_64011-0347_finalreport.pdf
# `water bodes` surface roughness changed from 0 to a value used in WRF
# `wetlands` surface roughness changed from 11 to 1.1 (presumed error)
# `no data` added with same roughness as `permanent snow and ice`
#  added a new value of 250 for 'mangroves'
